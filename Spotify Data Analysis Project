#Spotify Data Analysis Project

#Schema:
CREATE TABLE Spotifydata (
    id               INTEGER        PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_name      VARCHAR        NOT NULL,

In this project, I inserted Spotify data into the above table and came up with some questions I thought would be useful for business data collection.
##Queries:

##1. Who are the top 5 most popular artists?

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

##Result: 
Ed Sheeran
Glass Animals
Olivia Rodrigo
The Neighbourhood
The Weeknd

##2. Name the track names that are the top 3 in danceability.

SELECT track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 3;

##Result:
Qué Más Pues?
LA NOCHE DE ANOCHE
Fiel

##3. Which artist(s) has the most popular track available on this list, and what is the track name?

SELECT track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity = (SELECT MAX (popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);

##Result:
good 4 u - Olivia Rodrigo
Bad Habits - Ed Sheeran

##4. Which 10 tracks have the lowest energy?

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy asc
LIMIT 10;

##Result:
traitor
Arcade
you broke me first
Someone You Loved
WITHOUT YOU
drivers license
Butter
Streets
Heartbreak Anniversary
MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)

##5. List the top 3 most popular tracks that feature another artist.

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name like '%feat%'
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 3;

##Result:
Peaches (feat. Daniel Caesar & Giveon)
INDUSTRY BABY (feat. Jack Harlow)
Levitating (feat. DaBaby)
