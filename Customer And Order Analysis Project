#Customer And Order Analysis Project

In this project, I used SQLiteStudio to answer questions about customer orders based on the monthly sales data available.
##Queries:

##1. How many many unique orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(Distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

##Result: 9,268 unique orders were placed in January.

##2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(Distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

##Result: There were 379 unique iPhone orders placed in January.

##3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

##Result: There are 11,986 customer account numbers available for all orders that were placed in February.

##4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT Distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

##Result: The AAA Batteries (4-pack) was the cheapest product sold in January. It's price is $2.99.

##5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) *ROUND(price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Product asc;

##Result:
