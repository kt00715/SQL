#Customer And Order Analysis Project

In this project, I used SQLiteStudio to answer questions about customer orders based on the monthly sales data available.
##Queries:

##1. How many many unique orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(Distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

##Conclusion: 9,268 unique orders were placed in January.

##2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(Distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

##Conclusion: There were 379 unique iPhone orders placed in January.

##3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

##Conclusion: There are 11,986 customer account numbers available for all orders that were placed in February.

##4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT Distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

##Conclusion: The AAA Batteries (4-pack) was the cheapest product sold in January. It's price is $2.99.

##5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) *ROUND(price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Product asc;

##Conclusion:

20in Monitor: $23,650
27in 4K Gaming Monitor: $121,680
27in FHD Monitor: $62,850

##6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

##Conclusion: The AA Batteries (4-pack) was sold at this address in February. The quantity sold was 2 and the revenue made was $7.68.

##7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT (Distinct customers.acctnum) AS customer_quantity, ROUND(AVG(FebSales.Quantity * FebSales.price),2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

##Conclusion: 278 customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February. The average amount spent was $13.83.
